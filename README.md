# Prepare for How to use

Hello, this can be used if you already have installed mysql and libmysqlclient-dev.

A quick google search will do if not.

## Functions

Also, currently we can only create the database on mysql, 
with a script that it is used from a template file.

By default it will be added to the git repository so you
can have the template to work with it yourself.
